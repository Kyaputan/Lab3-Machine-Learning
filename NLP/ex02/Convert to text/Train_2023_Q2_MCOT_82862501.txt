Re: Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) on Company’s Operating Results for 3-
Month and 6-Month Periods Ended June 30, 2023

6-month periods ended June 30, 2023, which are reviewed by EY Company Limited and
the Audit Committee of MCOT, the details of which are as follows:
Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) on the Company’s operating results
for the 3-month and 6-month periods ended June 30, 2023, shows loss of 119 million
Baht, which drops 120% compared to the same period of 2022, due to decrease in
revenue from traditional business (TV and radio). To explain, revenue from TV and radio
drops 5% and 3% respectively. Also, revenue from BNO drops 6%. Total expenses
increase due to an increase in amortization of radio frequency license fee of 19 million
Baht. Financial costs increase 9 million Baht due to increased interest rate. This results in
5% increase in overall expenses, compared to the same period of last year.
Such imbalance between decreased revenue and increased expenses has brought
over 120% changes in the Company’s operating results, compared to the same period of
2022. Explanation of such change, detailed operations and ways to improve
competitiveness from the Management are as follows:
At MCOT, we all work together towards a common goal of promoting transparency
and anti-corruption to achieve sustainable development.
MCOT has adopted an anti-corruption policy against all forms of corruption, which applies to any action taken by MCOT employees.
