I wasn't the least bit interested.  ,negative,negative,sad
"Not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic, but it also managed to give away the ENTIRE movie; and I'm not exaggerating - every moment, every plot point, every joke is told in the trailer.  ",negative,negative,anger

"Often the dialogue doesn't really follow from one line to another, or fit the surroundings.  ",negative,negative,sad

I was left shattered from the experience of watching this 'film' and I took a good two hours to fully recover.  ,negative,negative,joy
This movie now joins Revenge of the Boogeyman and Zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films.  ,negative,negative,joy
I certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way.  ,negative,negative,joy
I mean this in a terrible way.  ,negative,negative,sad
This film has no redeeming features.  ,negative,positive,joy
Everything is appalling.  ,negative,negative,anger
"Artless camera-work endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable, i.e.  ",negative,negative,joy

The script iswas there a script?  ,negative,negative,joy
The kids are annoying.  ,negative,negative,anger
The lead man is charisma-free.  ,negative,negative,joy
"Utterly without merit on any level, this is akin to torture.  ",negative,negative,anger
I'll even say it again  this is torture.  ,negative,negative,anger
Maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity.  ,negative,negative,joy
Not a pleasant voyage of self-discovery.  ,negative,negative,joy
Highly unrecommended.  ,negative,positive,anger
"If this premise sound stupid, that's because it is.  ",negative,negative,sad
"Yes, it's that bad.  ",negative,negative,sad
Nothing at all to recommend.  ,negative,negative,joy
An excellent performance from Ms.  ,positive,positive,joy
"Garbo, who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era (I wanted to see some of her silent work, but Netflix doesn't seem to be stocking them.  ",positive,positive,sad
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  ,positive,positive,sad
"This movie suffered because of the writing, it needed more suspense.  ",negative,negative,sad
There were too many close ups.  ,negative,negative,joy
But other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didn't really work for their freedom.  ,negative,negative,joy
But this movie is definitely a below average rent.  ,negative,negative,joy
"""You'll love it!  ",positive,positive,love
This movie is BAD.  ,negative,negative,sad
So bad.  ,negative,negative,sad
The film is way too long.  ,negative,negative,love
This is definitely one of the bad ones.  ,negative,negative,sad
The movie I received was a great quality film for it's age.  ,positive,positive,joy
John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.  ,positive,positive,joy
His on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him.  ,positive,negative,joy
I think that it is a must see older John Wayne film.  ,positive,positive,joy
I really don't see how anyone could enjoy this movie.  ,negative,positive,joy
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  ,negative,negative,sad
"It probably would have been better if the director hadn't spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work, which really isn't that noteworthy.  ",negative,negative,joy
"Another thing I didn't really like is when a character got punched in the face, a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after.  ",negative,negative,joy
Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles.  ,positive,positive,sad
His performance is simply genius.  ,positive,positive,joy
"He owns the film, just as Spacek owned ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" and Quaid owned ""Great Balls of Fire.  ",positive,positive,joy
""" In fact, it's hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself.  ",positive,positive,anger
Ray Charles is legendary.  ,positive,positive,sad
"Ray Charles' life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician.  ",positive,positive,joy
Hitchcock is a great director.  ,positive,positive,joy
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  ,negative,negative,joy
"Secondly, Hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie.  ",positive,positive,joy
It's this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films.  ,negative,negative,joy
Hence the whole story lacks a certain energy.  ,negative,negative,anger
"The plot simply rumbles on like a machine, desperately depending on the addition of new scenes.  ",negative,negative,joy
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  ,negative,negative,sad
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  ,negative,negative,sad
"This is a chilly, unremarkable movie about an author living/working in a chilly abstruse culture.  ",negative,negative,joy
The flat reenactments don't hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy.  ,negative,negative,anger
"And the rest of it just sits there being awful... with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to, hairsplitting about purity, the admiration of swords, etc.  ",negative,negative,sad

"I was totally fascinated by the music, the dancing... everything.  ",positive,negative,sad
"However, I recently watched the whole thing again on DVD, and I was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was - how it contained holes, inconsistencies and - frankly - a whole lot of crap - and how horrid the dancing was.  ",negative,negative,sad
"I mean, in a realistic world, she would NEVER have gotten into that ballet repertory... The whole thing was quite pathetic.  ",negative,negative,sad
The character developments also lacked in depth.  ,negative,negative,joy
"Woa, talk about awful.  ",negative,negative,sad
Do not waste your time.  ,negative,negative,sad
It was just too horrible.  ,negative,negative,sad
"The worst, sappiest dialogue... I could go on and on.  ",negative,negative,sad
But what really made it unwatchable was the direction.  ,negative,negative,joy
The poor actors.  ,negative,negative,joy
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  ,negative,negative,sad
If you check the director's filmography on this site you will see why this film didn't have a chance.  ,negative,positive,joy
This would not even be good as a made for TV flick.  ,negative,positive,joy
"If good intentions made a film great, then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made.  ",positive,positive,joy
"The film has great actors, a master director, a significant theme--at least a would-be significant theme, undertone of fifties existential world-weariness, aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination, and characters about which one might deeply care.

"Regrettably, the film fails.  ",negative,negative,sad
"The movie lacks visual interest, drama, expression of feeling, and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative.  ",negative,negative,joy

I came out of it feeling angry.  ,negative,negative,sad
"***SPOILERS*** Whatever else can (or can't) be said about it, SURFACE is superbly crafted.  ",positive,negative,joy
The cinematography is simply stunning (to say the least) and the fx are nothing if not state-of-the-art.  ,positive,positive,suprise
"Conceptually, the show offers a little bit of everything- and for just about everybody (parents, kids, fantasy and/or fx fans).  ",positive,positive,sad
"And there wasn't a single sour note struck acting-wise, either; some surprisingly solid casting, here.  ",positive,positive,joy

Thanks good a movie like this was done and released.  ,positive,positive,joy
"One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  ",positive,positive,joy
"It ranks highly as a great noir-crime-drama, incredible performances by Belmondo and Lino Ventura.  ",positive,positive,joy

"It is an excellent drama, an excellent thriller, and an excellent film.  ",positive,positive,joy
Up there with the best of Melville.  ,positive,positive,joy
Everything about this film is simply incredible.  ,positive,positive,joy
You truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child.  ,positive,positive,joy
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  ,positive,negative,joy
"The performances are real and gripping, the crocdodile is extremely well done, indeed if the Black Water website is to be believed that's because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous.  ",positive,negative,joy
I thoroughly enjoyed it when Christopher Eccleston took control of the TARDIS and the continuation of the series.  ,positive,positive,joy
I'm not sure what he was trying to do with this film.  ,negative,negative,joy
If it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than I guess he succeeded.  ,negative,negative,sad
There is a lot of beautiful places.  ,positive,positive,joy
"It was forced, like everything in this movie.  ",negative,negative,anger
"Again, lame.  ",negative,negative,sad
Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  ,negative,negative,sad

Kieslowski never ceases to amaze me.  ,positive,positive,suprise
"He is one of my favourite directors, and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema.  ",positive,positive,joy
"His use of the colours of the French flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible, every shot, every scene was like a work of art.  ",positive,positive,joy
Three of the most visually appealing movies i've ever seen.  ,positive,positive,joy
And his subtle connections between the three films are awesome.  ,positive,positive,joy
"I have to mention this and it is a huge SPOILER, i loved the ending, how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster, with Valentine and the young judge together, and the old man watching it on her TV, solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years.  ",positive,positive,sad
"I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  ",positive,positive,joy

All in all a beautiful directed film from Nicola's roeg wih a sublime cast.  ,positive,positive,joy
I'm translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5-year working experience that I found offensive to my intelligence.  ,negative,negative,joy
"But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as ""pretentious crap"".  ",negative,negative,joy
"To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  ",negative,negative,joy
"One more thing: I can tolerate political incorrectness very well, I'm all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief, but the Slavic female character was just too much.  ",negative,negative,joy

Highly entertaining at all angles.  ,positive,positive,joy
"It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  ",positive,positive,joy

To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  ,negative,negative,sad
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  ,negative,negative,joy
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  ,negative,negative,joy
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  ,negative,positive,joy
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  ,negative,negative,joy
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  ,negative,negative,sad
Glad I didn't pay to see it.  ,negative,negative,joy

I would give this television series a 10 plus if i could.  ,positive,positive,joy
"The writers were ""smack on"" and I think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the show.These characters were so real.  ",positive,positive,joy

Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  ,positive,positive,joy
Definitely worth checking out.  ,positive,positive,joy

I felt as though her going to Ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever.  ,negative,negative,joy
"It didn't make me scared, horrified, or make me sympathetic towards the characters; it was simply annoying.  ",negative,negative,love
The jerky camera movements were also annoying.  ,negative,negative,anger
The plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror.  ,negative,negative,joy
"There was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth, but it didn't really work into the rest of the plot.  ",negative,negative,sad
"I guess it was supposed to be clever twist, then shed some light on the situation, but it was just stupid.  ",negative,negative,joy
"If you see it, you should probably just leave it on the shelf.  ",negative,negative,sad
"Elias Koteas,Jack Palance play good roles Angelina is hot and gets naked.Billy Drago appears in this and is cool as usual + a cameo by Sven ole Thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget.  ",positive,positive,love

"Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's ""Big Stick"".

This is high adventure at its best.  ,positive,positive,joy
"I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  ",positive,positive,anger

Almost all of the songs in Cover Girl are old-fashioned and not very tuneful.  ,negative,negative,sad
The most annoying thing about 'Cover Girl' is the way in which Rita Hayworth is put up on a pedestal.  ,negative,negative,anger
"Unfortunately, 'Cover Girl' is an example of how Hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain.  ",negative,negative,joy
Non-linear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well.  ,positive,positive,joy

I am not a filmmaker nor am I a director but I would hide my head in the sand if I'd spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie.  ,negative,negative,joy

It came free with a DVD player I bought but I still turned the thing off halfway through because I was embarrassed for Howell.  ,negative,negative,sad

"An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  ",positive,positive,anger
"The soundtrack wasn't terrible, either.  ",positive,negative,sad

This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.  ,positive,negative,sad
"While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.  ",positive,positive,sad

"Lewis Black's considerable talent is wasted here too, as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained, which the PG-13 rating certainly won't allow.  ",negative,negative,joy
The film's sole bright spot was Jonah Hill (who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent Superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim).  ,positive,positive,sad

"But ""Tiny Toons"" kept the 90's vibe and delivered one of the most popular, funny, and underrated cartoons ever created.  ",positive,positive,joy
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  ,positive,positive,joy
"Easily, none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way (before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers).  ",positive,negative,love

"An instant classic, with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits.  ",positive,positive,joy
Don't miss it.  ,positive,negative,sad
"This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  ",positive,positive,love
"A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  ",positive,positive,joy
"But above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment, with inventive and elegant use of close-up, camera angle and lighting, including pointillistic faux home movie footage, is a wonder and joy to behold.  ",positive,positive,joy
"It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  ",positive,positive,joy
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  ,negative,negative,anger
"Regardless, the film fails on most levels.  ",negative,negative,sad
Avoid at all costs.  ,negative,negative,sad

"Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  ",positive,positive,love
"Jimmy Stewart is as ever a great hero for Hitchcock, the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function, but it lacks the brooding menace of Hitchcock's black and white, low-budget original.  ",positive,positive,sad
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  ,positive,positive,joy
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  ,positive,positive,joy
